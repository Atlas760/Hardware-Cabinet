Hardware Cabinet is a simple CRUD API used to store electronical products, such as PCs, Smartphones, etc...
This API also implements OAuth2.0 via GitHub and Google login.

Ideas for future addons:

1) Create a database that stores objects (H2, JPA)
2) Create a UI for CRUD operations (Thymeleaf)

Project created for a university exam, powered by Spring Boot and Auth0 frameworks.
